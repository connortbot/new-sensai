    <p>Several years ago, a group of 3 young boys sought a way to communicate without nosy teachers, (or god forbid, women) from understanding them.
      <br>In their journey, they created Sensai. But soon after, they discovered that it was, frankly, a pain in the ass to learn or speak.
      <br>And so, Sensai's design philosophy transformed overnight. It was never meant to be widely used. It does not have a culture to back it up. It is purely a language meant to be learnt.
      <br> Now, almost reaching a decade old, the newest dialect dubbed 'New Sensai' is everything we hoped it would be.
